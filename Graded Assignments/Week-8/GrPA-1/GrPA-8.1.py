'''Write a recursive function named reverse that accepts a list L as argument and returns the reversed list.

You do not have to accept input from the user or print output to the console. You just have to write the function definition.'''
def reverse(L):
    if len(L) <= 1:
        return L
    # Bring the last element to the front
    # And reverse the first n - 1 elements
    return [L[-1]] + reverse(L[:-1])
