#A sequence of five words is called magical if the i(th) word is a substring of the (i + 1)(th) word for every i in the range  1â‰¤i<5. Accept a sequence of five words as input, one word on each line. Print magical if the sequence is magical and non-magical otherwise.

#Note that str_1 is a substring of str_2 if and only if str_1 is present as a sequence of consecutive characters in str_2.
